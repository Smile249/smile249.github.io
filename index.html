            This is a fairly new hobby to me. At first I didn't even know receiving imagery from
            weather satellites is a thing. <br>
            For the first couple of months I used a V-dipole<sup><a href="images/vdipole.jpg" target="_blank">1.0</a></sup>
            antenna I made myself using some wood from the back of my yard, <br> some garden wire and coaxial wire.
            I could receive APT<sup><a href="images/NOAA19_July13.png" target="_blank">1.1</a></sup> <i>(Automatic Picture Transmission)</i> 
            signals with that from NOAA <br> satellites. Shortly after Meteor-M2 N2-3 launched, which featured
            higher quality images and actual colored <br> images<sup><a href="images/METEORN2-3_2July.png" target="_blank">1.2</a></sup> using the same V-dipole antenna.
            Although the transponder of this satellite is rather iffy and not very consistent.

        <p class="right">
            After I saved up some money I started going for a HRPT <i>(High Resolution Picture Transmission)</i> setup, which consisted out of a dish antenna. Overall 80cm in diameter is recommended but my best 
            best was a 60cm one. Many people switched over to digital or tv via an app now in my area. So there aren't many cheaper options for a good second handed dish anymore.
            I made a helical antenna with a 3D printed scaffold and put it all together onto the dish. It took me quite a few tries to get a good signal that resulted into an image.
            The first actual HRPT signal I received was NOAA 15 but the signal was too weak due to it's half broken transponder. Keep in mind that these HRPT signals are also way higher frequency
            than the APT ones (APT is 137MHz and HRPT is 1.7GHz). They are also harder to receive due to higher bandwidth, etc. I had to buy an LNA <i>(Low Noise Amplifier)</i> which had a filter and amp built into
            it so I could properly receive all of the satellite's data. If I had a bigger dish it would've been less of a problem but it's highly recommended to anyone.
